        <h2 id="intro-heading">Innovative Teaching &amp; Learning Design</h2>
	<p>This site highlights  some of the work of scientist,
	educator, science communicator, and innovator, Michael Fenton. He is a
	professional member of the Royal Society of New Zealand, and a
	multi-award-winning scientist, educator, and education lecturer. He has
	worked as an education consultant, with expertise in course and
	programme design, resource writing, assessment design and assessment
	moderation. He has taught STEM subjects at all levels from Primary to
	Tertiary/Polytechnic, and mentored teachers in the compulsory education sector and
	vocational education and training sectors.</p>
	<h3 id="the-nexus-research-group">The Nexus Research Group</h3>
	<p>Ahead of his time, Michael volunteered his "spare" time as founder and director of New Zealand’s only research group
	based in a secondary school. Children of all ages were encouraged to "build it, test it, use it"
	foreshadowing the Maker Movement and Citizen Science. Former head of JPL, and the main driver for
	the deep space NASA missions, <a href="files/michael-fenton-bill-pickering.pdf" target="_blank">Dr William ‘Bill’ Pickering</a> was Patron. The motto “Question Everything” encouraged the technically able
	as well as the academically inclined learners to make authentic
	discoveries as citizen scientists. Findings were presented at <a href="files/michael-fenton-nzms-conference.pdf" target="_blank">research conferences</a>, provided to the Ministry of Education, and published on the <a href="files/michael-fenton-nexus-research-group.pdf" target="_blank">Nexus Research Group</a> website. The website received 5,000 uniqure visitors per month.
	<p>School students of all ages and abilities regularly won Science Fair awards and prizes,
	validating Michael's approach of 'teach to interests and abilities, NOT age group'.</p>
	<h3 id="education-research-and-innovation">Education research and innovation</h3>
	<p>Do-It-Yourself amateur home-made lab equipment was invented and
	trialed by Michael to encourage authentic hands-on learning in Science
	and Mathematics classes but also open opportunities for cross-curricula learning. 
	This was part of his 'teach to interests and abilities, NOT age group' philosophy, a response 
	to seeing teachers in schools telling younger learners 'wait until you are older' to use science equipment. 
	Michael pioneered the wider use of digital multimeters (DMM) as inexpensive science data loggers in Primary
	classrooms and cross-curricula Secondary school Science and Maths lessons. A variety
	of home-made sensors are possible, many cost just a few cents, able to detect a wide
	range of environmental factors. Michael's innovation is still being shared, inspiring
	Primary teachers in New Zealand to do more hands-on science.</p>
	<p>Michael was also the first to research and publish the use of school
	Casio FX-9750 calculators to a $8 Picaxe sensor unit. He has invented a method
	to pause RECEIVE() without a COM error, permitting timed sensor recording. His research, code and schematics were part of
	his Ministry of Education E-Learning Fellowship report. Other
	education forums and websites reproduced parts of his work. Soon after,
	Michael invented a Real-World Interactive Games and Electronic Link
	(RIGEL) Windows application combining the various sensor and Picaxe
	circuits.</p>
	<p>He repurposed a free game design application - Game Maker - to create RIGEL as a gamified universal science 
	and technology user interface. Update in 2025, RIGEL can plot real-time graphs and simultaneously log data as a science tool.
	RIGEL can also use real-world sensors to control virtual game players or use an exercycle to ‘fly’ around a 3D
	virtual island. Michael's RIGEL app can speak te reo Maori and other languages, control robots
	remotely, and mimic an industrial measurement and control (IMC) system. Students use
	maths, science, and technology integrated into real-world applications. They also have fun!</p>
	<h3 id="course-design-innovation">Future-focused qualification & course design</h3>
	<h4 id="NCEA-alternative">NCEA / UE alternative; new NZQA approved future-focused qualification</h4>
	<p>Dr Christine Fenton and Michael Fenton completed the design and application for the Green School New Zealand programme to deliver a New Zealand 	Certificate in Study and Employment Pathways (Level 3 and Level 4). A first in New Zealand, the private international school has been accredited to offer an alternative to NCEA. Students gaining the Certificate also meet University Entrance requirements. This foreshadowed the New Zealand government's intention to replace the National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA). The proposed new system closely mirrors many elements of the qualification designed by Christine and Michael.</p>
	<blockquote><span lang="en">"This school really has achieved the creation of the most relevant, inspiring and beautiful curriculum and pathway that will lead learners on to local and global universities, and beyond.”</span></blockquote>
	<h4 id="teacher-professional-development">In-service teacher STEM professional development</h4>
	<p>Michael lead the design, writing and delivery of NZQA approved Level 7 Science and Mathematics Teaching qualifications. These online courses raised in-service teacher confidence and competence to deliver engaging, authentic and hands-on learning activities. Michael mentored teachers and principals as they completed action research projects focused on raising learner achievement. Michael's exceptional contributions earned him several prestigious awards.</p>
	<blockquote><span lang="en">"I have been privileged to visit the Open Polytechnic to see their online science and maths teaching courses first hand, and I know how impressive they are. The best thing is that the programme enables teachers to study while working, allowing teachers to put what they learn online into practice almost immediately." - MP Chris Bishop</span></blockquote>
	<h3 id="science-communicator">Science communicator</h3>
	<p>Michael has been a keynote speaker at education conferences, and won
	a number of awards. His work has featured in newspaper articles and conference videos, and been covered on radio, TV, education magazines and education journals. Michael visited schools and volunteered for many years to assist organise and promote the Taranaki Science and Technology Fair.</p>
	<p>Michael builds interactive props from TV and movies, including a TARDIS, a Dalek, a Ghostbusters proton pack, and an authentic working B9 Environmental Control robot with embedded AI.</p>
	<p>His research and STEM teaching innovations have been presented at various science, mathematics and digital technology conferences, and shared on his website.</p>


<blockquote><span lang="en">"Michael has a wealth of diverse experience in education, and his focus is lately on assisting teachers to make science and maths learning practical, fun, and hands-on. He uses active learning (project-based learning) to engage in authentic tasks, using a variety of technologies, some of which he has invented himself." - SciCon Science Teachers conference</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span lang="en">"Michael’s lecture was titled 'Putting the science back into science education – reclaiming the maker space'. He talks about current realities for most science teachers: the equilibrium they need to find between authentic learning, teaching for assessment, and staying abreast of the evolving impact that digital technology continues to have on education."</span></blockquote>
	<h3 id="research-active">Research active</h3>
	<p>Michael stays research active, following the latest news in AI, quantum computing, science generally, and education research. He presented an analysis of the state of the New Zealand Science curriculum and Digital Technology curriculum. His findings highlighted that curriculum reviews should happen at shorter intervals, and that much of the coding and electronics taught nationally still dates back to technology from the late 1990's. Omitting quantum computing and analogue circuits appears to be short-sighted and fails to ensure a future-focused curriculum.</p>
